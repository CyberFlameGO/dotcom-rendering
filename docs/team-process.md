# Processi

Key principles:

-   prioritise _focus_ (unless you are a manager/leading across multiple things)
-   work hard to provide clarity and transparency over your work and key
    milestones/objectives at any one time
-   ensure basic hygiene around how we develop code

## Git (commits, branching, PRs)

Atomic commits.

Feature branches, with initials.

PRs - make them rich!

Code review + frequency.

## Documenting things

ADRs.

## Incidents

(runbooks)

Comms:

-   Dotcom and Skynet channels
-   Core CP
-   Dig Dev Incidents for serious (P1) issues

_If the issue is serious enough to drop existing work to fix, it merits a retro._
